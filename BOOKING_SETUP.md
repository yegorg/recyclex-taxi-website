// Lines 114-117: Replace YOUR_SERVICE_ID and YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID
const response = await emailjs.send(
    'YOUR_ACTUAL_SERVICE_ID',
    'YOUR_ACTUAL_TEMPLATE_ID',
    templateParams
);
```

## 6. Test the Form

1. Open `booking.html` in your browser
2. Fill out all required fields
3. Click "Book Now" / "Rezervova≈•"
4. You should see a success message and receive an email at recyclexsk@gmail.com

- **Multi-language**: Success/error messages adapt to the current language (EN/SK)
- **User Feedback**: Loading states and confirmation messages
- **Email Format**: Professional booking request emails with all details
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with helpful messages

## Troubleshooting

### Form Not Sending
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify all three values (Public Key, Service ID, Template ID) are correctly set
- Ensure EmailJS service is properly connected to Gmail

### Not Receiving Emails
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify the template "To Email" is set to recyclexsk@gmail.com
- Test the EmailJS service directly from their dashboard

### Validation Issues
- Ensure all required fields have proper `name` attributes
- Check that email format validation is working

## EmailJS Free Plan Limits

- 200 emails per month (free tier)
- For higher volume, consider upgrading to a paid plan
- Alternative: Set up a simple PHP backend for unlimited emails

## Security Notes

- EmailJS public key is safe to expose in client-side code
- No sensitive server credentials are exposed
- Email content is sent through EmailJS servers securely
